#### Information

* Spring boot automatically provides an embedded servlet container and a persistence layer based on Hibernate (as JPA provider).

* Data are automatically stored in an in-memory database H2. Changes are lost after restarting the application.

* All REST endpoints can be tested locally with the Swagger UI frontend:

    [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
